# gogate
Report server/service status. This is not just another metrics system, it is
just a tool to reflect your current infrastructure facts without effort

# when to use it?

- When you have a horriable infrastructure, you may find this useful. 
- When you have a good infrastructure, and a CMDB to control the `desired status`, you can still have it to serve as an view to `current status`.

# design

- GET /: Redirect to master on node; Return all nodes on master
- GET /self: current node status
- POST /: Not allowed on node; Create new record on master
- GET /health: show health status json
